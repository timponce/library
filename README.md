This is a Library application that allows you to add Books into a library along with information like book title, author, total pages, and pages read.

To use, simply fill in the appropriate information in the input fields and click on the green '+' button to add a book to your library. Keep adding as many books as you wish.

To delete a book, click the red 'x' button on the top right corner of the appropriate book you wish to remove from your library.

To increase the number of pages read, press the '+' button next to the pages read number on the selected book to increase the pages read by 1 for each click. You can also decrease the number of pages read by pressing the '-' button.
